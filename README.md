## OH! TreadMill Project

# Vision:

OH! TreadMill envisions merging physical fitness with blockchain technology to provide a unique, interactive experience. Users can connect their digital wallets via WalletConnect and earn points for their workout sessions. 

This innovative integration will bring together health, convenience, and digital rewards, motivating users to stay active while benefiting from a royalty-based rewards system.

# Description:

OH! TreadMill is a fitness device equipped with an interactive screen that allows users to scan a WalletConnect QR code to link their crypto wallet. 

Once connected, users' workout sessions will be recorded, and points will be accumulated based on the intensity and duration of their exercise. 

This data is sent to a secure cloud system that displays personal information, including previous workout stats, real-time updates, and future fitness goals, making the treadmill experience personalized. 

The system will also calculate royalty points that can later be redeemed for rewards or converted into loyalty tokens.

# Target Market:

* Fitness Enthusiasts: People who are interested in staying active and want to track their progress through modern, digital platforms.

* Crypto & Web3 Enthusiasts: Those who are already familiar with blockchain and crypto and are looking for new ways to incorporate Web3 into their lifestyle.

* Gyms & Wellness Centers: Fitness establishments looking for advanced solutions to enhance member engagement.

* Tech-Savvy Users: Individuals who appreciate innovative technology and desire seamless integration between their fitness goals and digital life.

# Path to Market:

# Work Mode:

  Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how **SmartFit** and **TreadMill** would work in **Manual Mode** and **Live Mode**:

### 1. **Manual Mode**

**Overview:**  
Manual Mode allows users to operate the treadmill and other fitness devices without a real-time internet connection or external live class integration. Users can still log their workout data locally and sync it with the app later when they are online. This mode is ideal for users who want to focus on their individual training without external guidance or feedback during the session.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Device Control:**  
  Users manually set their speed, incline, or resistance levels on the device, with no input from a live coach or AI.
  
- **Offline Logging:**  
  The device records workout metrics like distance, speed, duration, calories burned, and heart rate if available. These metrics are stored locally until the user connects to the internet.

- **Workout Customization:**  
  Users can set their own goals and challenges (e.g., run 5 km, burn 300 calories) without interaction from live trainers. The treadmill or device tracks and displays progress toward these goals.

- **Delayed Sync:**  
  After the workout, when the user reconnects to the internet or syncs with their WalletConnect, the workout data is uploaded to the SmartFit app, where points are calculated, and user stats are updated. Users still earn loyalty points and royalty awards based on performance.

- **Basic Interface:**  
  The on-screen display shows real-time metrics like distance, speed, time, and calories burned. It does not feature any live streaming or interactive elements.

#### **Use Case Example:**  
A user goes for a 30-minute treadmill run in Manual Mode. They adjust the treadmill speed manually to their desired pace and finish the workout. Afterward, they sync their wallet and treadmill data with SmartFit when they have internet access. Their points are then calculated, and the system records their session.

### 2. **Live Mode**

**Overview:**  
Live Mode connects users to real-time classes, live trainers, or an AI-driven system that guides their workout sessions. This mode is designed for users who prefer interactive and immersive experiences with instant feedback, progress tracking, and social engagement. The treadmill or device will adjust settings dynamically based on the live instructor or program.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Connectivity:**  
  Live Mode requires an internet connection. Users scan their WalletConnect to access live features like classes, AI trainers, or real-time data syncing. The device connects to the cloud and SmartFit app, continuously updating workout metrics and point calculations.

- **Interactive Classes and Coaching:**  
  Users can join live sessions with fitness instructors or AI coaches who guide the workout. For example, the treadmill speed or incline might automatically adjust during the session based on instructions or program parameters. This provides a more dynamic experience where users can focus on their effort rather than adjusting settings.

- **Live Leaderboards & Competition:**  
  In this mode, users can compete with others in real time. Leaderboards display how users rank based on their performance metrics (e.g., speed, distance, calories burned), adding a social and competitive element.

- **Instant Feedback:**  
  As the user works out, live data such as heart rate, calories burned, and points earned are displayed on the treadmill screen or the SmartFit app. The user gets real-time feedback on their progress and performance compared to others in the session.

- **Dynamic Adjustments:**  
  Based on the live workout plan, the treadmill can automatically adjust incline, speed, or resistance to match the intensity of the session. For example, if the instructor calls for a sprint, the treadmill increases speed without the user having to make manual adjustments.

- **On-Screen Enhancements:**  
  The screen shows not only workout stats but also live class information (e.g., instructor's pace guidance, workout intervals, and motivational prompts). It may also show your ranking on the leaderboard, other participants, and live session stats.

- **Instant Point Calculation:**  
  Points and rewards are calculated in real time based on the intensity and duration of the workout. Users can track how many points they’re earning as they progress through the session. These points can be used for rewards or transferred as loyalty tokens.

#### **Use Case Example:**  
A user connects their wallet, chooses a live class, and joins a 45-minute interval running session. As the class progresses, the treadmill automatically adjusts incline and speed based on the instructor’s cues. The user competes against others in real time, tracking their ranking on a leaderboard, and earns points during the session. After the workout, all stats are synced instantly, and they can view detailed reports and their rank within the class.
